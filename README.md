## About the Developer

This application was written by **Nikolas Tuz**, a software engineer from Ukraine. It represents my **first serious application** and serves as the foundation for my **master's qualification work**. 

While most of the **design for Viatours** was created by me, 3 out of the 20 pages were picked from Figma templates. I do not own the rights to those specific pages, but all remaining designs are my own. This project reflects my journey in learning and implementing full-stack development concepts, and Iâ€™m proud to showcase it as a demonstration of my skills. This app is not about commercial use at all.
